Inheritance Class Polymorphism
What about classes with child classes with the same name? Can we use polymorphism there?

Yes. If we use the example above and make a parent class called Vehicle, and make Car, Boat, 
Plane child classes of Vehicle, the child classes inherits the Vehicle methods, but can override them:

Example

Create a class called Vehicle and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of Vehicle:

'''
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def move(self):
        print("Move!\n")

class Car(Vehicle):
    #def move(self):
    #    print('Vroom!\n')
    pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Sail!\n")

class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Fly!\n")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang") #Create a Car object
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747") #Create a Plane object

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
    print(x.brand, x.model)
    x.move()
'''
Child classes inherits the properties and methods from the parent class.

In the example above you can see that the Car class is empty, but it inherits brand, model, and move() from Vehicle.

The Boat and Plane classes also inherit brand, model, and move() from Vehicle, but they both override the move() method.

Because of polymorphism we can execute the same method for all classes.
